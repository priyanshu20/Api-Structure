## Flask optimal file structure for APIs

This is a demo api to demonstrate the proper file structure to be followed when trying to develop a scalable and readable flask API

It can also be used like a base template for any apis you want to build going ahead, basic user authentication is already set up ,api requests limit is also set up and can both be accessed using easy to use decorators

## Improvements you can do as the app grows
* Move the validation schemas into a seperate file
* Split the routes based on their namespaces
* if the app grows more you can split the models into seperate files like the routes and put them in the models folder
